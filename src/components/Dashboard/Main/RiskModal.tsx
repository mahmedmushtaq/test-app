              [Token % out of the entire circulation] 0.58% were transferred. A
              significant movement is detected when there are more than 1% of
              the tokens in circulation that were moved in a single transaction.
              Such a significant movement usually triggers movements in the
              asset's price and therefor should be monitored closely.
